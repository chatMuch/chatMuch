We really fit together like puzzle pieces -- all having pretty good JS skills and understanding, and individual skills that complement each other. 

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Dion - public speaking

Cullen - getting down to business

Tyler - communication

Sunny - researching

Tim - business acumen 

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

We plan on meeting up every day at 9am and having a team standup. We will update each other every step along the way, but those meetings will serve as the foundation of our organization. We will also use Trello for project management to ensure that the workload is evenly distributed. We will also be available on Slack for any potential assistance requests. 

### Conflict Plan


- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Our conflict resolution process will be to discuss any issues that come up as a team, and meet up as a whole team if the issue persists. We will ask Jacob Knaack to intervene should the issue spiral out of control. 

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

This will be addressed as part of our conflict resolution plan.

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Trust the process, and be kind to one another (see: Mr. Roger). Keep cool and care. 

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

Ask if that team member needs help. Have them be a part of pair programming. 

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

We will escalate any major issues to Jacob Knaack.


### Communication Plan


- What hours will you be available to communicate?

9-5 for quick responses, with some major leeway for the evening.

- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack.

- How often will you take breaks?

Every hour or so.

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Scale back our stretch goals, evaluate, and adjust.

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

Slack, turn on push notifications.

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

We will have a communication manager. Tim Egorov will be communication manager.

- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Communication manager will ensure that everyone gets a chance to speak during standups. 


### Work Plan

Trello will serve as our project management tool. 

- What project management tool will be used?

Trello.


### Git Process


- What components of your project will live on GitHub?

All of them.

- How will you share the repository with your teammates?

We created an organization where all of us are members.

- What is your Git flow?

ACP but every new feature will live on a different branch. Dev branch and production branch. We will have code reviews before approving merges, we'll need at least 2 approvals so no one can merge single-handedly.

- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - How many people must review a PR?

    2.

  - Who merges PRs?

    Non-authors.


  - How often will you merge?

    ACP by end of day, or whenever a major feature is implemented. 

  - How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

    We will slack each other when a major feature is ready to be merged, and we will have a review at the end of each day.
